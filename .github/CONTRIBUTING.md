## Report bugs!

Do **not** open an issue on Github if you think your discovered bug could be a **security-relevant vulnerability**. Please, read our [security policy](../SECURITY.md) instead.

Otherwise, just create a [new issue](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/issues/new) in our repository and state:

- What's your Parity version?
- What's your operating system and version?
- How did you install parity?
- Is your node fully synchronized?
- Did you try turning it off and on again?

Also, try to include **steps to reproduce** the issue and expand on the **actual versus expected behavior**.

## Contribute!
