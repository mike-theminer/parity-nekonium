//! Miner module
//! Keeps track of transactions and mined block.
//!
//! Usage example:
//!
//! ```rust
//! extern crate ethcore;
//! use std::env;
//! use ethcore::ethereum;
//! use ethcore::client::{Client, ClientConfig};
//! use ethcore::miner::{Miner, MinerService};
//!
//! fn main() {
//!		let miner: Miner = Miner::with_spec(&ethereum::new_foundation(&env::temp_dir()));
//!		// get status
//!		assert_eq!(miner.status().transactions_in_pending_queue, 0);
//!
//!		// Check block for sealing
//!		//assert!(miner.sealing_block(&*client).lock().is_some());
//! }
//! ```
